VERSION HISTORY


v15.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- now miner supports up to #384 epoch (4GB DAG size). Note that previous versions support up to #299 epoch, you will not be able to use old versions after #299 epoch.

	then start miner with admin rights to install new driver automatically when necessary (or use "-driver install" option directly). 
	If you have any problems with signed driver you can use "-driver install_test" option, it uses old approach: enables Test Mode (reboot is required) and installs unsigned driver.
- added "-showpower" option for stats about GPU power consumption, press "s" to see it. Both AMD and Nvidia cards are supported, except Linux gpu-pro drivers and Radeon7 cards.
- updated Remote Manager to show total power consumption.

- Bug fixes, a few minor improvements.



v3.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- reduced delays at shares sending, it must improve speed on pools a bit.



v3.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- improved Ethereum mining speed by 1-15% (depends on mining mode and card model, slower card - more speed improvement).
- added "-etha" option to select Ethereum algorithm optimized for your cards.
- added "-allcoins" option to support Ethereum forks mining.
- miner checks all Ethereum shares before sending them to the pool. You will be warned if some GPU finds invalid share, usually due to overclocking.
- miner disconnects from the pool if there are not any new jobs for a long time.
- "-tt" option now can set target temperature for every card individually.
- "-tt" option now can set static fan speeds.
- fixed issue with -cclock and -mclock options. However, AMD blocked underclocking for some reason, you can overclock only.
- option "-wd 1" is set by default now.
- option "-ethi" for values less than "4" now sets very low GPU load to avoid any freezes in Windows. The most low GPU load is "-ethi 0".
  Also "-ethi" now can set intensity for every card individually.
  You can also specify negative values, for example, "-ethi -8192", it exactly means "global work size" value that is used in official miner.
- Bug fixes.



v2.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added Stratum support for Decred.
- Added "-esm 2" option for "miner-proxy" Stratum version - for such pools like coinotron, coinmine, etc.
- Default "-dbg" value is "0" now, log file is created by default. You can disable it with "-dbg -1" option.
- If GPU thread hangs and its speed is not updated, miner shows zero speed for that card.
- Added "-wd" option.
- Added "-r" option.
- Additional checks related to DAG files: checking disc space, removing invalid DAG files.
- Bug fixes.



v1.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added "-ethi" option.
- Added coloring.
- "-mode" option now can be set for every card individually.
- "-dcri" option now can be set for every card individually.
- Added "-allpools" option.



v1.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed issue with rejected shares for dwarfpool (and for other pools that use similar code).
Fixed issue with f2pool pool.
Added "-eworker" option.
"-dcri" option: max value is 500 now.
Added "Rejected shares" info.



v1.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- First version.
