Team Red Miner Nimiq Mining
============================
This document provides some quick pointers on how to best test and
tune for the Nimiq argon2 variant.


WALLETS IN MINING OS CONFIGS
----------------------------
IMPORTANT: in both Hive and SMOS, the Nimiq wallet needs to be passed
without spaces, i.e.  "NQ69ABCD...." instead of the user-friendly form
"NQ69 ABCD ....".


Pools
-----
TRM only support Nimiq dumb mode mining, and not over secure
websockets but plain tcp. This is not a mode supported by
pools. Therefore, TRM runs a separate process as a network proxy
converting the plain tcp traffic into secure websockets messages.

The proxy is now integrated into the miner and executed automatically
unless you disable it using --nimiq_no_proxy as a command line
argument. There are also arguments for controlling the local port and
the path to the proxy binary. See --help or USAGE.txt for more info.

The bundled binaries are built from the source found here:

https://github.com/Kerney666/trm_nimiq_proxy

You can also run the proxy outside of the miner. Follow the
instructions in the proxy github, pass --nimiq_no_proxy as argument to
the miner and pass the IP+port where the proxy is listening for the
stratum pool argument.

Use the --nimiq_worker=myrig argument to set a device name for your
workers that is passed to the pool(s).


Tuning
------
Nimiq tuning is more or less identical to Turtlecoin Chukwa
tuning. See our separate tuning guide TRTL_CHUKWA_TUNING.txt.


Nimiq Tuning Parameters
-----------------------
There are no tuning parameters for Nimiq, it just runs. Play with your
clocks to adjust behavior and power draw.
