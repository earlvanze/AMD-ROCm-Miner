The miner reports GPU hash rates every 30 seconds.  These are the full GPU hash rates before dev fee deduction (your pool hashrate will be slightly lower). 

The miner includes a read-only api based on the sgminer-5.5 API.  Both the json and text formats are supported.  For more details, we refer to the sgminer api documentation.

For reporting bugs and/or for features requests, please open an issue on this project's github [issue tracker](https://github.com/todxx/teamredminer/issues).

For example command lines please see the batch/shell scripts in the miner download packages.
For command line options see the [USAGE.txt](USAGE.txt) file that comes with the miner.

-----------
Changes in v0.7.18

1) Support for the ETC fork added. Run with "-a etchash" for easiest support, see "--eth_variant_mode" in the help for more info.

2) ETH+ZIL miners: add "--eth_dag_cache=0" to use a second dag cache and prebuild epoch 0 immediately at miner start.

3) Ethash miners relying on ramp-up and stagger for stability: the default mode of these tweaks has been changed to off. They now need to be enabled with --eth_ramp_up and --eth_stagger. While helping a number of rigs, these tweaks caused increased instability of others, making the choice of a good default mode difficult.

Release notes:
- Added etchash support (see algo etchash and --eth_variant_mode).
- Added dag cache support, mostly intended for eth+zil mining (see --eth_dag_cache).
- Fixed hex char parsing in enable/disable submenu, can now work with >= 10 gpus.
- Changed the default for ethash ramp-up and staggering to false (see --eth_ramp_up and --eth_stagger).
- Added check for broken win setups with duplicated opencl platforms and/or devices.

Changes in v0.7.17

Release notes:
- BETA: Added fan control, see --help section or USAGE.txt. Enable with --fan_control.
- Fixed deadlock bug that could happen when using multiple pools with the failover strategy.
- Added option for not sending stale shares (see --no_stale_submit).
- Added watchdog check for early gpu init hangs.
- Added example watchdog scripts for win/linux.

Changes in v0.7.16c

BETA RELEASE - small fixes for Turtlecoin's new algo chukwa2.

Release notes:
- Chukwa2: fixed kernels loading for Radeon VII gpus.
- Chukwa2: fixed mem footprint for 2GB gpus.

Changes in v0.7.16b

BETA RELEASE - adds Turtlecoin's new algo chukwa2. Not tested as rigorously as other versions. Only use for the Turtlecoin fork.

NOTE: Navi gpus are NOT supported on chukwa2 for now. Support will be added if there's sufficient interest.

Release notes:
- Added algo trtl_chukwa2 for the Turtlecoin fork on 2020-10-22.

Changes in v0.7.15

Small bugfix release.

Release notes:
- Ethash: fixed bug for ZIL (epoch 0) mining on 4GB gpus (bug appeared in 0.7.14).
- Ethash: reverted to v0.7.10 kernels for stability purposes except for ROCm-based rigs.

Changes in v0.7.14

This release wraps up our work for 4GB gpus mining ethash. Linux 4GB are verified to mine up to and including epoch 381 on drivers 18.50/19.30/19.50/20.10. After that, we have added support for extended mining from epoch 382 and up. Extended mining is a trade-off between hashrate and being able to mine at all, gpus will lose additional hashrate for every extra epoch. Please see the Linux section in the ETHASH_4GB_HOWTO.txt for more details and instructions.

Release notes:
- Ethash: verified Linux support for 4GB gpus up to and including epoch 381.
- Ethash: added support for extended 4GB mining from epoch 382 and up.
- Kawpow: cleaned up false hw errs for some block heights.

Changes in v0.7.13

1) Windows user with 4GB rigs - see the new guide ETHASH_4GB_HOWTO.txt for instructions.

Release notes:
- Added better default Windows dag allocation strategy on 4GB gpus.
- Added experimental support for resetting gpus before mining (Windows only).
- Added argument for manual adjustment of 4GB dag allocation (see --eth_4g_alloc_adjust=X,Y,Z,...).
- Added protection against broken dev servers with additional random server selection mechanism.

Changes in v0.7.12

1) Bugfix release: v0.7.11 could crash with rejected ethash shares.

Release notes:
- Fixed print format bug on ethash rejected shares.

Changes in v0.7.11

1) Ethash additions: printing share diff in GH (always enabled), hashrate watchdog (see --eth_hashwatch).
2) Better debug support: --long_timestamps, --pool_debug.
3) We've found certain motherboard/bios combinations that due to kernel and/or driver bugs have issues with the first or last gpu in rigs. If you see excessive hw errors reported on a single gpu, and switching around gpus still always generates errors in the first or last gpu, try using --eth_dag_alloc_patch.

Release notes:
- Added DAG allocation patch under linux for certain mobo/bios combinations (see --eth_dag_alloc_patch).
- Added ethash hashrate watchdog (see --eth_hashwatch).
- Added ethash abort mechanism for Vegas on ROCm (see --eth_direct_abort). Not useful in other contexts.
- Added pool traffic debug (use --pool_debug).
- Added print of share difficulty for ethash family algos. Unit is always GH.
- Added microsec timestamp resolution in logs (use --long_timestamps).
- Regression bug: argon2/chukwa was broken in 0.7.10, now working again.
- Turned off compute mode checks for non-Polaris gpus.

Changes in v0.7.10

Release notes:
1) Ethash 4GB rigs, especially on win, _should_ use --eth_alloc_epoch=N with N being the max epoch that the gpus can allocate. This will avoid DAG reallocation issues.
2) For Navi rigs having issues with eth+zil or Nicehash mining with frequent DAG switching, try using --eth_dag_slowdown=9.

- Added default log filename (trm_<algo>_<yyyymmdd_hhmmss>.log)
- Added ethash forced initial allocated epoch ( --eth_alloc_epoch=N). Note: HIGHLY recommended for 4GB rigs.
- Added ethash family DAG build slowdown configuration (--eth_dag_slowdown=N, default value 4).
- Added ethash family DAG build staggering across gpus (disable with --eth_no_stagger).
- Added ethash family intensity ramp-up (disable with --eth_no_ramp_up).
- Added option for forcing dev fee region (see --dev_location).
- Added MTP for Navi gpus.
- Added MTP ramp-up after pad rebuild.
- Fixed error printouts on failed watchdog script execution on Linux.
- Stats: now shows more clocks and temps, and also adds gpu state in hashrate prints (see --short_stats to disable).
- Added checks for and enabling compute mode and disabling crossfire on Windows (see --enable_compute).
