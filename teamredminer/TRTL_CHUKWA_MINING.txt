Team Red Miner Turtlecoin Chukwa-512 Mining
===========================================
This document describes how to tune for the Argon2id-512 algo used by
Turtlecoin.


2GB/4GB Cards
=============
The algo allocates ~1.2GB of ram and should run on 550 2GB gpus and
up. At the time of writing, we have not done any tests on <= 4GB gpus
though.


Characteristics
===============
Chukwa-512 runs quite lean. Mem clock and timings is _everything_. For
max hashrate you actually _need_ to downclock the core clk to find
your sweet spot.


Polaris Tuning 
==============
For Polaris (470-580s) cards, crank up your mem clock as much as
possible and use optimized straps. We have mostly tested using CN
optimized straps which seem to work fine. 

After maxing the mem clock, proceed by lowering your core clock. You
should see your hashrate fluctuate slightly. My sweet spot during
testing was around 1050 MHz, yours might be different.

Next, proceed to undervolt as much as possible while keeping your rig
stable.

Last, using the rx boost (--ref) tweak with the AMD Mem Tweak Tool by
eliovp can give you a boost as well.


Vega Tuning (56/64/VII)
=======================
For Vega 56/64, we recommend flashing ref V56s with the corresponding
V64 bioses. Mem latency is important for the Vegas for Chukwa. Modding
mem timings using the AMD Mem Tweak Tool by eliovp will help a lot for
Vegas.

The typical configuration for a Vega 56/64 is simple: max your mem
clock, pull down your core clock to e.g. 1137 MHz, undervolt as much
as possible. Also try to find your sweet spot for the core clk, it
could boost the hashrate somewhat.

Next, if you want to maximize your hashrate, you need to apply mem
timings. We recommend running with stock timings to make sure the rig
is stable first though. Then, try either our recommended timings in
CN_MAX_YOUR_VEGA.txt in order Lucky, Weaker, Conceal (for V64s). Or,
use your own timings. Personally, I run with the leaner Conceal on my
V64s.

For Radeon VII, this is one of the few algos where a maxed out mem
clock at 1200 MHz actually provides a better hashrate. Cooling is
often the bottleneck for VIIs. Play with your clocks until you find a
reasonable hashrate vs power draw vs cooling setup. Modding timings
can also help for the VIIs, not very common.
