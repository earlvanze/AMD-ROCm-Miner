VERSION HISTORY



v12.6
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- added Vega cards support (ASM mode).
- added ASM mode for RX460/560 cards (+20% speed).
- new GPU sorting method for AMD cards. Now GPUs are sorted by physical bus index (it matches AfterBurner list of GPUs). Also the list of temperatures/fans matches the list of GPUs automatically.
  Therefore "-di detect" and "-gmap" options are not necessary and not supported anymore.
  WARNING: be careful if you use use separate overclock/temperature settings for every card, due to new sorting method GPUs can get different indexes!
- added fan/OC support for 17.7.2 (and higher) drivers.
